## Research

Our group mainly studies the problems associated with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and explores the Earth, or even other planets, with it. SAR is one of the most important instruments for Earth observation. We are entering the golden age of SAR remote sensing. Unlike most optical instruments, SAR is an active sensor that transmits pulses toward the Earth and then receives the back-scattered echoes. Therefore, SAR does not require the illumination from the Sun and can image in daylight or at night. SAR operates at microwave bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. The microwave signals can go through clouds, which enables SAR to work in all-weather conditions.

## SAR Signal and Image Processing

The original data acquired by SAR is called raw data, which is much like pure noise if you view it with an image application. Through signal processing techniques, or focusing, an image can be formed. Further processing, e.g. denoising, is thus performed in the image domain for numerous purposes. Previously one of our group’s focuses is on the processing of data acquired in advanced modes such as spotlight, ScanSAR, TOPS and SweepSAR, which requires more sophisticated signal processing algorithms (e.g. Liang et al., 2017, IEEE TGRS).

## InSAR Algorithms and Software Development, and High Performance Computation

A SAR image is a complex image with both magnitude and phase. By comparing the phases of two radar images, InSAR can measure topography or deformation on the Earth’s surface. The cool thing about satellite InSAR is that it measures deformation on the ground with centimeter or even millimeter precision at an altitude of about 700 km in space. Furthermore, the measurement is an image, which is like deploying millions of GPS stations on the ground to monitor the deformations. By processing many InSAR images with time series analysis techniques, we can further track the temporal evolution of the deformations, which has wide applications.

InSAR is comprised of a number of processing steps, and still has challenges or even bottlenecks. The algorithms are continuously evolving. With ever-growing number of satellite SAR missions and advanced imaging capabilities, the amount of SAR data is exploding - SAR is also entering the big data era. This brings new challenges and opportunities especially for InSAR time series analysis and requires efficient processing techniques.

## InSAR Error Corrections

While the microwave is travelling in the atmosphere, its phase is mostly affected by two layers of the atmosphere including troposphere and ionosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere. The water vapor in troposphere causes phase delay to microwave signals. The ionosphere can extend from 50 km to 1000 km above the Earth’s surface. Its formation is mainly because the neutral atoms or molecules in the atmosphere eject free electrons after absorbing solar radiation. The free electrons cause a phase shift to the traversing microwave signal. Previously our group has extensively studied the effects of ionosphere and developed a number of techniques to correct its effects.
